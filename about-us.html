            Quickit is created to improve the service in your restaurant. Not
            remove it.<br /><br />

            Quickit came from the need to reduce waiting times during the busier
            periods and has since developed into a concept that also benefits
            your guests visiting the restaurant, therefore increasing sales
            within your business - because it has never been easier to order,
            and Quickit never forgets to ask if the guest wants more.

          At Quickit, we believe that personal service is still the best - and
          if that is what you want, then you have come to the right place.
          Furthermore, we believe that the collaboration between the server and
          virtual server, i.e Quickit, is the perfect combination for those who
          want to accomodate your guests in every conceivable way. <br /><br />

          We see every corner of the world that the digital wave has taken hold,
          and has swept across all industries. This also applies to the
          restaurant industry.<br /><br />

          We are facing a future where not a single second will be left to
          chance, because we want to spend our precious time wisely - and
          because we have the choice.<br /><br />

          Whether your guests want to take advantage of your skilled waiters, or
          whether they want to sit in their own thoughts and order with Quickit,
          let the choice be theirs - and enjoy it at the same time.

            At Quickit, we believe that efficiency and digitalisation go hand in
            hand, and we believe that the service can be significantly
            streamlined with Quickit as an assistant. We are there to reduce the
            waiting time for the consumer, and to assist the waiter during the
            busiest hours.

            We look to the future, a new generation that expects everything to
            be at hand and that calculates sparingly with its time. That
            expectation and calculation Quickit will meet. Our vision is to be
            considered the waiters assistant - so Quickit will be an
            indispensible part of your team, helping all restaurants to achieve
            their goals.
